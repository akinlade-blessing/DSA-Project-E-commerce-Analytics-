## Project- Documentation
## Introduction
My project work after a three month training as a student of Data Analysis in Incubator hub- DSA.

## Project Topic: Analysis of Amazon Product Review and Customer's Review

### Project Overview
As a data analyst at RetailTech Insights, I analyzed Amazon product data. 
The primary goal of this project is:
 - Highlight top products and review trends for marketing strategies
 - Understand feedback patterns and ratings for customer engagement, to generate actionable insights that drive improved decision-making, and revenue growth.

### Dataset Overview
The data set has a total record of 1,465 rows and total field of 16 columns. 

### Background:
As the e-commerce industry continues to grow, businesses require more sophisticated analytics to remain competitive. By leveraging data from platforms like Amazon,businesses can better understand market trends, optimize pricing and inventory, and personalize customer experiences.

### Objective
 - Identify top-rated products
 - Identify low rated products
 - Analyze product rating
 - Identify total number of products
 - Identify total number of reviews per product category
 - Identify products with high reviews 

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here was supplied by Incubator hub which is for the training. 

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  - For data collection
  - For data cleaning
  - For creating calculated columns
  - To create the pivot tables
  - To create the dashboard

### Methodology
To achieve the final results, these steps were performed on the data.
 - Data Cleaning   ---
Microsoft Excel was used to clean and make the data easy to understand. The delimeter tool was used to split some columns, new columns were created (e.g potential revenue, High discount, Price bucket range).
 - Creation of pivot tables
 - Visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and summarizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, patterns, and relationships before applying any formal modeling or statistical techniques.
The folowing analysis were done on the data and result is represented and expressed in the pivot tables and visuals
 - The average discount percentage by product category
 - The total number of product listed under each category
 - The total number of reviews per category
 - The product with the highest ratings
 - The average actual price versus the discounted price per category
 - products wth highest number of reviews
 - Product with 50% discount or more
 - Distribution f product ratings
 - Total potential revenue by category
 - The top five products in erms of rating and number of reviews combined
 - Categories with hghest number of discount
 - Products with less number of reviews

## Analysis
The product with the highest number of review is the Amazon high speed cable. This signify that this product is of high quality but the product might not be the product with the highest revenue. This might be because of the product price or the availability of the product in the market. I will advise that Amazon focus more on the availablity of the product in the market.
I will advise based on this analysis carried out that Amazon focus more on electronics because it is the product with the highest revenue. It is not the product with the highest discount price yet customers purchase it more.

### Recommendations
The Amazon product review analysis should be done at regular intervals to help provide valuable insight for improvement, customer satisfaction, marketing strategies and driving busness growth. 

The reviews should be monitored. This helps identify customer concerns, improves product quality, enhance customer satisfaction and inform business decision to drive growth.
